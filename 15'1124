# Now the task: What is the effect of heaving only High-School against having graduated from

# 1st alternative: 
# Simply multiply the MPE(at means) by 4:

P_1-P_0
# let's compare it to the 4*MPE:
four_mpe_means

# So 4*MPE is larger, we overestimate the true effect. Why is it so?

# odds for Logit Model:
# We need to specify an individual for which we are computing it,

# dummy variables:

# Odds for the "mean individual":
P_l=1/(1+exp(-(logit$coefficients%*%t(mean))));P_l
odds_l=P_l/(1-P_l);odds_l

# But we can do it in an easier way:
odds_l1=exp(logit$coefficients%*%t(mean));odds_l1
# We get exactly the same number.


# Odds for the mean individual in the probit model:
P_p=pnorm(probit$coefficients%*%t(mean));P_p

For an individual with mean characteristics in our sample, the probability to work is about 40%
